Go package cache implements LRU (Least Recently Used) cache algorithm.

Cache capacity can be optionally limited by both size in bytes and a number
of items. Items can keep track of their modification and access time.

INSTALLATION

	$ go get github.com/dchest/cache

DOCUMENTATION

	See http://godoc.org/github.com/dchest/cache


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Some code structure ideas are inspired by YouTube's Vitess implementation of
LRU cache, but no code was taken from it:
